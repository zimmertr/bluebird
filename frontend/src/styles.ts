/**
 * One type ramp, at two densities.
 *
 * Bluebird has two kinds of surface. The working chrome — control panel,
 * results table, map legends, chart — is dense: you scan it while doing
 * something else. The reading surfaces — the welcome and privacy dialogs, and
 * the analysis overlay card — are wide, and you read them once, carefully.
 *
 * They are not two scales. The dialog title is the panel header's title one
 * size up, and the dialog subtitle is the panel's subtitle one size up; even
 * the copy rhymes ("Weather Window Finder" / "The Weather Window Finder").
 * And the reading tier's small step lands exactly on the compact tier's base,
 * so the two share the 12px rung rather than running past each other. Naming
 * them as one ramp keeps a dialog from drifting into a second look.
 *
 * Within a tier, roles separate by weight and color, not only by size: two
 * sizes cover the whole compact tier because `subheading` and `control` share
 * both a size and a color and let weight alone distinguish "Elevation range
 * (ft)" from "Peaks". Roles that stand in that relationship are composed from
 * a shared constant below rather than spelled out twice, so the relationship
 * is something a test can assert instead of a comment that rots.
 *
 * Status text is not in the ramp. Warnings, errors and progress lines use the
 * base size with a semantic color (amber, red, sky, green) because there the
 * color carries the meaning, not the hierarchy.
 */

/**
 * The 10px step, for chrome that must not compete with what it labels.
 *
 * slate-400 rather than the dimmer slate-500 its sites had drifted between:
 * this step appears over three background lightnesses (the slate-900/85 map
 * legends, the slate-800/95 chart tooltip, the slate-700 table header bar) and
 * slate-500 measures 2.2:1 on the last of them, which is the one carrying a
 * required CC-BY credit. slate-400 clears all three.
 *
 * Baking the color in also keeps it honest: Tailwind resolves two competing
 * color utilities by their order in the generated stylesheet, not by their
 * order in the class list, so a call site cannot reliably override this.
